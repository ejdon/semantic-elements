  <h2>Restaurants</h2>
  <h3>Village Pizzeria</h3>
</header>
  <p>Located right on the water, they have some of the best pizza in town. They have both indoor and outdoor seating but they don't take reservations so plan to wait if you go during peak hours. However, the wait is worth it!</p>
  <p>They also offer take-and-bake, and if you visit a local grocery store, you may see some in the refrigerated section! Pro tip: try the pesto pizza!</p>

<h3>Useless Bay Cafe</h3>

      <p>Useless Bay Cafe is the best spot in town for coffee. Their kitchen is also open until 3PM and they have a great menu. Another pro tip: try the Sweet Bee Latte!</p>
      <p>They have plenty of great outdoor seating and, if you're lucky, you'll spot one of the many adorable bunnies that live in Langely. Great spot for dog watching as well!</p>
